# IBM-Watson
This bot chats with you to identify the food you have eaten. It provides feedback about how healthy the food was and it detects the mood of the user based on the messages typed.

The website I have deployed it in: https://food-coach-ram.mybluemix.net/

Go to IBM Watson Assistant Workspace and click import json to get the entire project.
